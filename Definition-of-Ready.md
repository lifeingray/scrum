# DEFINITION OF READY
The Definition of Ready is the gatekeeper between the Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog.  It is the document which baselines expectations for all Team members on the level of specificity necessary for an idea to become an actionable work item.  The Product Owner holds the lion-share of the responsibility for facilitating the Team to ensure every work item complies with this document — exceptions will be noted accordingly.

This document must be satisfied, in full, prior to moving work items from the Product Backlog to the Sprint Backlog near the conclusion of the Sprint Planning meeting.  There are special circumstances where select work items may be exempt from meeting all the criteria in the Definition of Ready, such as the relationship between interfaces and non-functional requirements.  Exceptions may be considered by an all-Team vote during the Sprint Planning meeting.  Absentee votes may be made by proxy but a no-show cannot veto at a later time.  The action of the Scrum Master moving work items into the Sprint Backlog constitutes a commitment for delivery on the behalf of the Team.

## BLOCKING REQUIREMENTS
Blocking Requirements can prevent a Sprint from being initiated or prevent work items from being actionable.

### Operators
Not a formal term in Scrum, Operators are a checklist of knowledge, resources, tools for a Team to conduct a Sprint.  These items are often facilitated outside the Team by Management.  If the criteria in this section is not met, a Sprint may not be conducted — even if individual work items meet the subsequent requirements in the Artifacts section.

		- Each User Story require a combined effort of less than 3 days of work by a single person
		- User Stories contain Tasks (Scrum Master) @now
		- Tasks w/ hour estimates (Scrum Master) @next @now
		- User Stories tagged accordingly with Themes @next @now
		- Visual Design, including all screen states, attached to each functional User Story
	- 21-40% are User Stories in active grooming
	- 41-100% is comprised of Epics
- Sprint Backlog
- Sprint Burndown template (Scrum Master)

## Non-Blocking Requirements
Non-Blocking Requirements do not prevent a Sprint from being conducted or work items for being actionable.  The only exception is a failure of timely communication on the part of the Team.  If organizational policies clearly state a required timeframe for specific approvals or decisions and the Team does not properly adhere to these policies, the items below are not considered non-blocking.  However, in the absence of official, written policy the criteria below are non-blocking.  For example, a Product Owner asks a Vice President to validate the approach to a work item during the period of Grooming and the executive doesn't provide feedback prior to Sprint Planning.

- Review by Architectural Group of all work items in Product Backlog tagged with @architecture
- Input or decisions by Stakeholders
- Input or decisions by Management
