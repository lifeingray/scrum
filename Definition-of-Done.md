# DEFINITION OF DONE
The Definition of Done is applied to three distinct components of Agile/Scrum: the User Story, the Sprint, and the Release. The Definition of Done works in concert with Acceptance Criteria to produce Potentially Shippable features.  The focal-point of the Definition of Done is to explicitly identify expectations for product quality which are consistent across all work.  Acceptance Criteria explicitly identifies expectations for product quality at a granular level as a component of a User Story.  The Definition of Done may evolve with each iteration.

Every member of a Scrum Team is bound by the Definition of Done. The responsibility for quality does not fall on the individuals responsible for testing and/or deploying code.

At the conclusion of a Sprint, during the Sprint Review, the Team must demonstrate compliance with the Acceptance Criteria for each User Story in the Sprint Backlog and the Definition of Done.

### BLOCKING REQUIREMENTS
Blocking Requirements can prevent work items from being considered Potentially Shippable.  If not satisfied during the Sprint Review, Blocking Requirements will result in the Abnormal Termination of a Sprint.
